       <h2>Could this be the best broccoli dish?</h2>
       
       <p>The internet says this will be the best broccoli of your life, or is it?</p>
       <p>In November 2008, Adam Roberts published a blog post with the headline “The Best Broccoli of Your Life”, 
           about a recipe from Barefoot Contessa Back to Basics. He promised that at least one person liked the broccoli
            more than steak. But things have moved on since then in the broccoli world.

            <h2>Want to grow your own broccoli? It's easier than you think!</h2>
            <p>Todd Heft is a lifelong gardener and the publisher of Big Blog of Gardening. 
                In his blog, <a href="https://www.bigblogofgardening.com/how-to-grow-broccoli-when-to-plant-where-to-plant-and-when-to-harvest/">
                    How to Grow Broccoli: When to Plant, Where to Plant and When to Harvest </a> Tom gives you all the info you need to grow your 
            own broccoli. </p>
            <p></p> Did you know, Mom was right – eat your vegetables!
            Brassicas are a fantastic nutritional choice, as these vegetables contain a wealth of phytochemicals.
             According to research from the National Institutes of Health, Brassicas “prevent oxidative stress, 
             induce detoxification enzymes, stimulate the immune system, decrease the risk of cancers, inhibit 
             malignant transformation and carcinogenic mutations, as well as, reduce the proliferation of cancer cells.” 
             That’s quite a nutritional benefit. If this family of vegetables is not regularly in your diet, 
             you’re missing out on substantial health benefits.</p>
